/* GOAL: Create the function "bringtofront". It will allow the user to move objects to 
 *   the front of a new xFig file by manipulating depth.
 * INFO: There are two type cases in this method, one for compound objects and one for 
 *   single objects. 
 *   FOR COMPOUND OBJECTS:
 *   1. When handling compound objects, think of ways to figure out the minimum and 
 *      maximum depth in a compound as well as the smallest depth in occupy. Look in
 *      'f_util.c' for methods to help you out with this.
 *   2. If the max depth minus the min depth is smaller than the smallest depth occupied,
 *      you will need to offset the compound's depth by a certain amount. Think of what
 *      you are attempting to offset when completing this calculation. Try to draw a
 *      picture to represent some compounds overlapping each other. Asign the compounds
 *      a depth, how would you mathematically compute which object to bring forward and
 *      by what amount?
 *   3. After you have completed the if else for offsetting the compound, you will need
 *      to swap the offset depth value of F_line *p by creating a temp F_compound pointer.
 *   4. Remove the compound depth of the copy pointer.
 *   FOR SINGLE OBJECTS:
 *   1. Create a variable to store the old layer's depth.
 *   2. Test three cases for the single objects.
 *   3. For the FIRST case, if the min depth is > 0 and the object's depth is not equal
 *      to 0, change the sent in pointer's depth p to the minimum depth. Then, add this
 *      depth to the single object and finally remove the old layer's depth.
 *   4. In the SECOND case, if the min depth is 0 but the object's depth is not equal to 0,
 *      let the user know that "Depth 0 ocupied, moving object anyway". Rather than
 *      changing the pointer's depth p to the minimum depth, we can just set it to 0.
 *   5. Create a default case if the above two conditions are not applicable.
 *   6. Redisplay the object.

 * INFO: There are two type cases in this method, one for compound objects and one for

 *   FOR COMPOUND OBJECTS:
 *   1. Look in f_util.c to find helper methods for finding largest or smallest depths in
 *      order to find out what to offset your compound by.
 *   2. There is a default case for offsetting if the max depth in the compound minus the
 *      smallest depth in the compound is smaller than the max total depth - the max 
 *      occupied depth.
 *   3. THere is also an edge case if the max occupied depth is occupied.
 *   4. You will then have to offset the depth of the compound by swapping.
 *   5. Finally, remove the copy compound used to swap.

 *   6. Redisplay the object.
 *   FOR SINGLE OBJECTS:
 *   1. Keep track of the single objects depth that will eventually be changed.
 *   2. You should have one normal case for if the largest occupied depth is not the max overall depth.
 *   3. In this case you should change your single object's depth to the max depth and remove the old one.
 *   4. You will also have one edge case if the largest occupied depth is the max overall depth.
 *   5. In this case you will need to change the single object's depth to the max overall depth.
 *   6. You will also need a default case if the single object is already at max overall depth when attempting to sendtoback.
 *   7. Finally, redisplay your object.
