TASK UNDO REDO

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS: 
https://github.com/Da-vid21/xfig-3.2.8a/issues/7 - GitHub Issue

GOAL:
The current Undo feature needs to be enhanced to support multi-level undo. This new 
feature will allow a user to undo or redo an unlimited number of times. The maximum 
number of undo/redo operations is only limited by the amount of available memory 
determined by the computer system.

INSTRUCTIONS:
In this task, the changing will impact all xFig's action. It means you will need to
creat new strutures and include this new behavior in a lot of different files. We will
work with one hashtag and some variations to help organize it. The hashtag is 
"#taskUndoRedo", but information was added in it to help you.
Follow this steps to make sure everything will work in the end:

FASE 1 - PREPARATION:
    Use a stack to keep the actions and then you can undo and redo it.

#taskUndoRedo_00: Action
    Add the new action in xFig in the file 'main.c'.

#taskUndoRedo_01: Create
    Create a structure in the file 'object.h'.

#taskUndoRedo_02: Create                
    Make the structure ready to use in 'u_create.c' and 'u_create.h'.       

#taskUndoRedo_03: Create
    Create functions to Undo and Redo in 'u_undo.c' and 'u_undo.h'.
    Create functions to free the history in 'u_free.c'.
    Organize the interface in the file 'w_cmdpanel.c'.

FASE 2 - USE:
    To include the behavior into the xFig, it is necessary to include the new behavior
    into a lot of diffent files. The needed functions are the one to update the
    history and the one to freeze additional undo actions.
    WARNING: In order to reduce the hashtag ocurrences, there is no hashtag in the 
    include section in this fase. Just Go to the begining and include the header file.

#taskUndoRedo_04: Update 
    Into each file with this hashtag, include the file with the Undo/Redo behavior 
    and call the function to update the undo history. 

#taskUndoRedo_05: Call
    Into each file with this hashtag, call the apropriated function.

**TIP: It is important that you understand what you will be implementing before you go in and create certain methods.
It is reccomended that you read through and analyze the entire u_undo.c file before attempting to code as this will help
you understand the methods you will be creating and why they are being created.

STEPS:
1. Open Visual Studio Code or your choice of IDE(open it from GitHub)
2. Click on the search icon on the left toolbar and search "#taskUndoRedo".
3. Use the direction provided as comments to work on the assignment.
5. Go to the desktop and double click the configure.sh file to compile/test.
