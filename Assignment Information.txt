#taskSendBack
-------------------------------- Instructions Start Here --------------------------------
SEND TO BACK / BRING TO FRONT

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS: https://github.com/Da-vid21/xfig-3.2.8a/

GOAL:
This project aims to create two new shortcut buttons for send-to-back and bring-to-front.
These buttons will allow the user to change the depth of selected objects.  The user will
be able to select an object and bring it to the top or bottom  layer for easier workflow.
It is necessary to create icons and functions and link it. However, this time more than
one function will be used. That way, it is better to add new files to manage the new
behavior.This project can be separated into three phases:

PHASE ONE: #taskSendBack_newFiles
  INFO: The files 'e_depthctrl.c' and 'e_depthctrl.h' are already created. Take a look
    into the  header file to check what is happening there. You will need to create a
    header file in the next task.
  GOAL: Go to the file 'e_depthctrl.c' and follow the instructions to create the two new
    functions.

PHASE TWO: #taskSendBack_addFiles
  GOAL: Since new files have been added, make necessary changes to the Makefiles and then
    re-configure the script.
  INFO: Click on the search icon on the left toolbar and search "#taskSendBack_addFiles".
    You should see 2 files with the hashtag. After you change them, re-configure the
    script. Use the configuring tutorial:

PHASE THREE: #taskSendBack_Icon
  GOAL: Create the icons and link the functions.

STEPS:
1. Open Visual Studio Code or your choice of IDE (open it from GitHub).
2. Check if you have opened the whole xfig folder.
3. Click on the search icon on the left toolbar and search "#taskSendBack". You should
   see 8 files with the hashtag.
4. Use the directions provided as comments to work on the assignment.
5. Go to the desktop and compile your code by double-clicking the 'compile.sh' file to
   check if your solution works.
