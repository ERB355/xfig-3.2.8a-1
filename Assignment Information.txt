TASK QUICK COLORING

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS: https://github.com/Da-vid21/xfig-3.2.8a/issues/6

GOAL: The primary purpose of this project is to allow the user to change multiple 
objects' fill/border using a shortcut button on the side panel. It is necessary to create
the icon and the function and link it. However, this time more than one function will be
used. That way, it is better to add new files to manage the new behavior. This project is
separated into three phases:

PHASE ONE: #taskQuickColoring_newFiles
  The file 'e_objcolor.c' is already created. Two functions are missing. 
  1) Go to the file 'e_objcolor.c' and follow the steps to create the new functions.
  2) Create the header file 'e_objcolor.h'. There are two functions that need to be 
     declared and extended (pass in void as the argument):
    a) fix_fillstyle is a function that updates the fillstyle if the color changes and 
       does not return anything. Pass in void casted to an object pointer as the argument.
    b) objcolor_selected is a function that changes an object's border/fill based on the
       color selected by the user and does not return anything.

PHASE TWO: #taskQuickColoring_addFiles
  Since new files have been added, make necessary changes to the Makefiles and then
  re-configure the script. Click on the search icon on the left toolbar and search 
  "#taskQuickColoring_addFiles". You should see 2 files with the hashtag. After you change
  them, re-configure the script. Use the configuring tutorial:

PHASE THREE: #taskQuickColoring_Icon
   Create the icon and link the function.

STEPS:
1. Open Visual Studio Code or your choice of IDE (open it from GitHub).
2. Check if you have opened the whole xFig folder.
3. Click on the search icon on the left toolbar and search "#taskQuickColoring". 
   You should see 9 files with the hashtag.
4. Use the directions provided as comments to work on the assignment.
5. Go to the desktop and compile your code by double-clicking the 'compile.sh' file to
   check if your solution works.
