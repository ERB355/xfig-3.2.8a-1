TASK UNDO SHORTCUT

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS: https://github.com/Da-vid21/xfig-3.2.8a/issues/4

GOAL: The goal of this project is to create a shortcut button that undoes the user's last
  action.

CHALLENGE: After undoing the action,  xFig  shows the message “Undo Complete”.  Change it
  and show the description of what was undone. Example: “The action Add was undone”, “The
  Join or Split was undone”.  You can try being very specific.  Example: “The Ellipse you
  deleted was created again.”

STEPS:
1. Open Visual Studio Code or your choice of IDE (open it from GitHub).
2. Check if you have opened the whole xFig folder.
3. Click on the search icon on the left toolbar and search "#taskUndoShortcut". 
   You should see three files with the hashtag.
4. Use the directions provided as comments to work on the assignment.
5. Go to the desktop and compile your code by  double-clicking the  'compile.sh'  file to
   check if your solution works.

If you are confused at any point with xFig or Linux environment,  check the youtube video
