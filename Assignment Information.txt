TASK DEFAULT DEPTH

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS: https://github.com/Da-vid21/xfig-3.2.8a/issues/1

GOAL:  This project's  goal is to increment the  depth  of new objects when added  to the
drawing.  When an object is added,  it does not have depth properties.  As a result,  all
elements are on the same  Z-axis.  It makes the drawing confusing.  It is not clear which
object was added first and last. You will need to change the properties of the objects in
xFig to increment their depth when added.
                       
You must add "w_indpanel.h" to every file you edit. That is the file that has
the depth value properties for every object.

STEPS:
1. Open Visual Studio Code or your choice of IDE (open it from GitHub).
2. Check if you have opened the whole xFig folder.
3. Click on the search icon on the left toolbar and search "#taskDefaultDepth". 
   You should see eight files to edit.
4. Use the directions provided as comments to work on the assignment.
   Try to work in the alphabetical order you see in VS Code.
5. Go to the desktop and compile your code by double-clicking the 'compile.sh' file to
   check if your solution works.
